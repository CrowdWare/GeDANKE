Ich speicher dies mal hier, weil deren Idee ist geil.

## What is TimeRepublik?

TimeRepublik is the world’s first purpose-driven social network. Inspired by the concept of time banking, TimeRepublik offers a global online platform for users to provide services in exchange for time coins that can be used to purchase other services on TimeRepublik. It has over 100,000 members in 100 countries and is based in New York. Its currency is a TimeCoin™, worth 15 minutes of time, which users exchange with each other for services.
How do I earn TimeCoins?

Users collect TimeCoins through completing requests for others. TimeCoins can also be earned through completing certain actions, like completing your profile on TimeRepublik.
What are the types of requests I can expect on TimeRepublik?

Requests vary, but most involve some sort of service, like graphic design help, lessons, writing/editing, or professional advice. Users are open to ask for any sort of help they might require.
I've offered my help in response to a request. What now?

Requesters will decide if they want to accept individual offers based on varying factors, such as how many TimeCoins they have, if they think the respondent would be a good fit, etc. There is no option for requesters to "reject" offers; you will know definitively if your offer has or hasn't been accepted when the request expires. During the consideration process, you can always message the requester and ask if he/she has any questions you can help with clarification.
What if I want to cancel?

Only requesters can cancel. If you offered help and can no longer perform the service, you must message the requester and ask them to cancel. Requesters can withdraw acceptance or pay you in time for a completed task.
What should I do when I’ve completed a task?

Message the requester to either deliver the final result, or remind them of payment for a concluded session. The requester of a task must then click "Pay" next to your offer in order to transfer you your earned TimeCoins.
I want to offer help, but I can't find any requests matching what I can do.

That can happen sometimes. That’s why we created the “services” function, where you can let TimeRepublik users know about the certain type of help you can provide. Can you teach easy guitar in 30-minute lessons? Can you help perfect someone's diction in French in 15-minute doses? Can you make a logo in 3 hours? Let people know! We just ask that you provide as much information as possible, including how long it will take to perform the task.
I want to work with a requester, but I don't quite agree on the amount of time they’ve estimated. What should I do?

Provide feedback via message to the requester that the time that they have specified will not be enough for what they need done. Suggest a more suitable amount of time for the task. If a requester agrees with your suggestions, he/she may open a new request specifically for you, with the TimeCoins you recommended.
I am unsatisfied with the work completed on my request. What are my options?

If you are unhappy with the work someone is doing, or has done, reach out to the provider of that service and explain how he/she can improve. Most of the time, users will be happy to redo a task. If they refuse, you can leave a negative public rating and feedback. No one likes receiving negative reviews, so most users will try to resolve an unhappy situation before it comes to this. If the both of you are unable to reach an agreement, please let us know. Be sure to overcommunicate wherever possible, as it will be through your exchanged messages that we will have the information we need in order to arbitrate disputes.
